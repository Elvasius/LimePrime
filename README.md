# LimePrime

Use the "listenForLimeInput" command once you have entered a "cerberus2" to start using the resource. This won't work on the other cerberus models cause they have different bone indices.

## Keys

For testing following keys are used

Left Shift => Spray

Space => Smoke

Left Alt => Bombs

## Sync

The grenade particles are synced by FiveM, the spray and smoke have to be manually synced.

## TODO
